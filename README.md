# Hate-Speech-on-Geography
Hate speech has become a pressing issue in the
digital age, with social media platforms providing a global
platform for disseminating such content. For example, in the last
couple of years, social media like Facebook has been extensively
used in subcontinent countries(India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, etc.)
to spread blasphemous speech and communal riots. However,
the definition of hate speech is not universal and varies based
on cultural and geographical contexts. Firstly, our project tries
to identify whether a comment is hate speech in the first place.
After that, we also explore the effect of geography on hate speech
by building a model that predicts the likelihood of a text being
regarded as hate speech in different geographical locations.
