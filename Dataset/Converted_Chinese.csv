男朋友没什么很明显的男权主义，但是如果我反对他做一些事，他会不理解。但如果我将我俩角度转换，变成我做那些事，他就知道事情的严重性了，就不去做了。,"Boyfriend doesn't have obvious masculinity, but if I object to him doing something, he won't understand.

"以及……我逛乙女tag不是为了治愈一下因看太多负面新闻有点疲惫绝望的心么？为什么我要在这个tag里继续看女孩子怎么被侮辱？这种tag不是应该是放肆“我可以”“我又好了”的地方么？,女性向的游戏，女主却靠着男人走出自卑走出阴影？作者本意是安慰那些受过伤害的女孩子？呸。这种文章不配代表受害者发言，真正被伤害到的人不会感觉被安慰，只有伤口一次次被揭开的痛苦。还是那句话，世上没有完全的感同身受，不要用你贫瘠的想象去揣度他人的内心想法。","And...Isn't I visiting Otome tags to heal my tired and hopeless heart from watching too much negative news? Why do I continue to watch how girls are insulted in this tag? Isn't this kind of tag supposed to be a place where ""I can"" and ""I'm fine again"" are presumptuous?

"被WA骂，不可怜。被WA editing子虚乌有的发言和事情来骂，可怜。能明白这个逻辑了吗？,你自己看原文，他捐钱归捐钱，哪里说后悔了？那WA说他公开说后悔合作公开指责不就是editing了？被editing不可怜吗？你拿事实说话说他捐款就是站队，粉丝完全没意见的。你添油加醋子虚乌有的发言，那当然受不了啊。 评论配图,你非要纠结的话，我认为是“不管TC内心怎么想的，他本来只想沉默（那是他的权利）却天天被媒体追着逼迫站队，不然就是代表他支持恋童癖。最后选择了较为中立的方式处理，也并没有指责攻击WA，已经属于很体面的公关行为了。结果还要被大导演两年后editing子虚乌有的发言来骂，这真的好可怜。”,问题是当时所有人都逼着合作过的小演员们表态啊，小演员们没人权呗。大导不需要谨言慎行，但是把别人没说过的话editing出来就很金卡戴珊了啊。明明没有公开说过后悔合作。","Being scolded by WA is not pitiful. It's pitiful to be scolded by WA editing's non-existent remarks and things. Can you understand this logic? , You read the original text for yourself, he donated the money to the donated money, how can he say he regretted it? Then WA said that he publicly regretted the cooperation and publicly criticized, isn't it editing? Isn't it pitiful to be edited? If you take the facts and say that his donation is to stand in line, the fans have no objection at all. Of course you can't stand the non-existent speeches you add to add fuel and vinegar. Comment picture, if you have to struggle, I think it's ""No matter what TC thinks in his heart, he originally wanted to be silent (that's his right) but he is chased by the media every day and forced to stand in line, otherwise it means supporting pedophilia on his behalf In the end, I chose a more neutral way to deal with it, and did not criticize and attack WA, which is already a very decent public relations behavior. In the end, I will be scolded by the big director Editing for his non-existent speech two years later, which is really pitiful.”, The problem is that at that time everyone forced the young actors who had worked with them to express their opinions. Young actors have no human rights. Directors don’t need to be cautious in their words and deeds, but it’s very Kim Kardashian to edit what others haven’t said. Obviously, he never publicly said that he regrets cooperating.",,0,China

这是一种偷换概念吧？如果那个人只是抨击阿萨里说他让人感到不适甚至恶心那OK，身为一个女生我完完全全接受但现在她是指控别人性骚扰，这就完全不同了。就如之前那个电台主持人说的她在毁了一场伟大的运动。毕竟这两者又着本质的不同,"This is a stealth concept, right?

"先从女性提高经济基础开始，其次尊重每个女性的意愿和权益，这是我能做的。,？？？我又被划分到「保护婚姻制度」的阵营了，感觉前面跟您说了那么多您都是「不听不听不听🙉」，您开心就好。加害者是掌握了经济基础优势的男权，不平等的从夫制婚姻制度只是这种霸权下的产物。反对婚姻制度并且把结婚并且追求平等婚姻的女性对立起来，就好像是放任了男性霸权而光抵制霸权产物。,「你结婚，活该你被家暴得妇科病」，和「你穿着暴露，活该被强奸被性骚扰」，您看这逻辑链是否类似？我们应该谴责受害者，先反对上层建筑的不平等；还是应该去谴责加害者，先从经济基础消除不平等呢？,我认为那是她们的自由选择。我个人是婚不婚均可，不必强行把我归类进必婚人士中，给别人贴标签划分阵营我不确定是否是您这类女权主义者的爱好。强迫不想反婚的女性反婚的才是伪女权，本质上和强迫反婚的女性结婚是一致的，这个逻辑也不确定您能否理解。,真正的女权实质应该是平权和维护人权，尊重包括且不局限于任何不想结婚不想生育、想结婚不想生育、想结婚想生育在内的所有权利。反婚反的是以婚恋霸权制造出的不平等婚姻制度，反的是「你必须结婚，不结婚就是怪胎」的谬论，让女性有充分地选择不婚的权利和舆论支持，并不是反个体的结婚行为。","First, start by improving the economic foundation of women, and second, respect the wishes and rights of every woman.

I personally can be married or not, so there is no need to forcibly classify me as a must-marriage person. I am not sure if it is a hobby of feminists like you to label others and divide them into camps. It is false feminism to force women who do not want to oppose marriage to oppose marriage.

The real essence of feminism should be equality and protection of human rights, and respect for all rights including but not limited to those who do not want to marry or have children, who want to marry but do not have children, and those who want to marry and have children.

"我觉得这篇长微博里有一个词很有趣：越界。 在社交场所，应该可以假定绝大多数人都在扮演他们觉得自己应该扮演的角色。而在一些女性的想象中，在社交场所可以扮演的角色实在屈指可数，并且在一些女性中间就是有这种相互奚落相互舔舐伤口的社交。某种意义上，这也意味着她们对对方的详细观察。,在社交场所里，有意或是无意地扮演一个未知的角色，这对于任何一个试图融入其中的参与者而言，都会担心自己收到的评价。未知的评价就是对原有界限的打破，当这个人意识到这一点后，她可能因为恐惧未知的评价而放弃扮演未知的，“越界”的角色。,如果越界指的是超过普通陌生男女交流的界限，那我是否可以理解为你们在扮演着互相试探的男女呢？就像你可以在电视上，文章里，以及别人的口中，经过或大或小的理解想象后的形象。 如果越界只是指社交越界，那我便要怀疑博主是否缺乏真诚，真诚地看见对方的心理状态，真诚地说话，让双方不尴尬地表演。,一个女性在去社交的时候，就在原本表演为女人的表面再加一层界限和指导，无论是心理上还是衣着服饰妆容上。这些东西是如此复杂以至于她的注意力完全集中在这些事上，成败取决于完美毫无瑕疵的细节。这也是一个原因。,因为只有通过详细观看并且归类对方的特征，并且给这一切按照感觉/直觉评分，找到话题，调动情绪，才能让这一切不那么无趣。这也是对话缺乏内容的体现。这种话和博主这样的人说的时候，自然会涉及到经常被别人说的男女性别差异，甚至是自己遇到的性别歧视问题。对方也有可能在刺探你的态度。","I think there is a word in this long Weibo that is very interesting: crossing the line. In social situations, it should be assumed that the vast majority of people are playing the roles they feel they should be playing. In the imagination of some women, there are only a handful of roles that can be played in social situations, and among some women, there is this kind of social interaction that ridicules and licks each other's wounds. In a sense, this also means that they observe each other in detail. In social situations, playing an unknown role intentionally or unintentionally, for any participant who tries to integrate into it, he will worry about the evaluation he will receive. Unknown evaluation is a breaking of the original boundary. When this person realizes this, she may give up playing the unknown and ""cross-border"" role because of fear of unknown evaluation. If crossing the boundary refers to exceeding the boundary of communication between ordinary strangers and men and women, then can I understand that you are playing the role of men and women who are testing each other? Just like you can understand and imagine the image on TV, in articles, and in other people's mouths after a large or small understanding. If crossing the boundary only refers to social crossing, then I have to doubt whether the blogger lacks sincerity, sincerely sees the other party's psychological state, speaks sincerely, and allows both parties to perform without embarrassment. When a woman goes out to socialize, she adds a layer of boundaries and guidance to the surface of her original performance as a woman, whether it is psychologically or in terms of clothing, clothing and makeup. These things are so complex that her attention is completely focused on these things, success or failure depends on the flawless detail. This is also a reason. ,Because only by watching and classifying the characteristics of the other party in detail, and scoring all these according to feeling/intuition, finding topics, and mobilizing emotions, can all this be less boring. This is also a manifestation of the lack of content in the dialogue. When people like bloggers say this kind of thing, it will naturally involve the gender differences between men and women that are often said by others, and even the gender discrimination that they encounter. The other party may also be spying on your attitude.",,0,China

我猜想，她眼中的“不是紧迫议题”，大约是“对我自己的lifestyle不紧迫吧”。我承认“反代孕”不是唯一议题，它是女性普遍失权造成的万千种现象中的一个。对于那些需要靠自己出嫁换彩礼，才能给兄弟娶老婆的女孩，对于那些家里紧张被迫去卖卵、代孕的女性，她们的人生在这一刻是“最最紧迫”的。,"I guess, ""not an urgent issue"" in her eyes probably means ""not urgent about my own lifestyle"".

But the problem is that the court said that the evidence is insufficient, so it can not be regarded as exoneration, so everyone thinks this does not mean that he has no judgment. You said you believed in the due process, isn’t that nonsense? The court didn’t fully clear him, and the person who accused him never questioned whether the court could make a judgment or not. You think it’s because your friend was accused and you can’t tell him. Did he do it or not? He insisted that he was wronged. After you have known him for many years, what is wrong with you deciding to believe him? I don’t know if she has a high EQ or not. I don’t know her. I just can’t understand why I can’t talk about my friend. No one said that I must support my friend unconditionally, but I know more about friends than you who are not his friends. Is there anything wrong with choosing to believe him after talking to him? What does this have to do with Manson? Manson's incidents are not Rashomon, and they must be compared with Fu Lanlan. It is true that Woody's accusation is much more serious than Fu Lanlan's, but Woody also does have such a loophole. The nature of the allegations of Fu Lanlan is not so serious, but there are many allegations. It is basically certain that he did have a misconduct and did not run away. Instead, Woody is a matter of a much more serious nature. No one except the parties involved knows what he did. Didn't do it and I didn't excuse her she thought Woody was a friend trust her I don't think there's anything wrong with someone knowing all the information we can get and think Woody just did it and I understand the truth is on him I don’t know what to think about this matter until now, and I don’t want to be in any team. I’m not talking about her acting in that movie. You said that she has no EQ and I don’t think about it. I absolutely agree, but the matter of Fu Lanlan is another story. We all make judgments based on news reports and the few words that broke out, but they definitely met each other in a circle. Didn’t she ask him to return her pin? I don’t know if Fu Lanlan did anything in front of her, but I don’t think it’s a double standard, it’s because people judge based on their own experience, maybe it’s because of their different positions. Other actors and Woody basically have a cooperative relationship. Scarlett has been his friend for so many years and muse for so many years. It is absolutely inseparable from Woody's support.

其实冠姓权应该在随母姓和随父姓达到五五比的时候才真正说明跟谁姓无所谓，独生女没有家庭继承的困扰，能享受跟儿子一样的待遇，但是大部分非独生家庭女儿继承的财产都比儿子少，只因为以后生的孩子随父姓。姓的源头意义为何女所生，其实姓归根结底是女姓。很多人说随谁无所谓，但孩子随母姓？不行,"In fact, the right to crown the surname should be when the ratio of following the mother's surname to the father's surname is five to five. The property of the father is less than that of the son, just because the child born in the future will follow the father's surname. The origin meaning of the surname is why it was born by a woman.

Men Sexual harassment is basically power harassment rather than sex discrimination. In fact, male compatriots are also harmed by sex discrimination.

小学一二年级的时间跟爷爷奶奶住，爸妈哥都不在身边，经常被附近三个五六年级的男孩欺负。十几年过去了，那些男孩怎么欺负的我，都忘的一干二净。但记得特别清楚的是，那年上初三住校的哥哥知道后赶回来拿铁棍去打了他们。回来后告诉我以后别把自己当做女孩子了，比男的还男的就没有男的敢欺负了。,"In the first and second grades of elementary school, I lived with my grandparents. My parents and brothers were not around, and I was often bullied by three boys in the fifth and sixth grades nearby.

是要经历很多困难，但会越挫越勇。可能是我的性格比较女汉子，也很自强自立。所以常常被认为不需要被照顾啊，就酱紫养成了独来独往的性格，到新环境里被很多人关心，常常很不舒服。我生长在潮汕，家里女儿就我一个，并没有重男轻女，但是我爹啊，常会说如果我是男孩就好了，可以不用出嫁，常伴他身旁。,"It is a lot of difficulties to go through, but the more frustrated you become, the more courageous you become.

这个就是普遍的女权问题而不是堕胎问题。社会应该形成女性敢于报警的制度和文化，而不是压抑其报警却容许（甚至鼓励）其悄悄堕胎。那样是女权的退步而不是进步。正确做法是：鼓励报警，惩罚罪犯，容许女性在经过合理程序后堕胎,"This is a general feminist issue, not an abortion issue.

他说的是强奸犯或别的什么，会入狱之类的。他说的没错，按美国法律，去追求个女生，人家说不，他坚持不懈。会被告stalking，也是性犯罪中的一个。何况美国的法律沉默也可以告强奸。有一点拒绝都可以告强奸。很容易被强奸了。跟我们国家不一样的。要求很严。,"He was talking about rapists or something, going to jail or something.

"问题就是，在“男的想生女的不想生”的情况下要给男性扣上一个直男癌的帽子我也是不太懂，不是所有想要孩子的男性都是抱着传宗接代的出发点吧,就是即使比如婚前说好了不想要有一方反悔了，那就好聚好散嘛。觉得离婚的女性就受伤害了，我不懂到底是女权还是卑微,就是这个道理！我始终认为女权应该是认为男女平等而不是高于男性一等，和同志平权一样，重点是“平”。女的不想要孩子，那干嘛还要跟一个想要孩子的在一起？我始终觉得要不要孩子是一个很大的问题","The problem is, I don’t understand how to label a man as a straight male cancer in the situation of “men who want to have children and women who don’t want to have children”.

I don't know whether it is women's rights or humbleness, that's the reason! I always think that women's rights should be regarded as equality between men and women rather than being superior to men.

In order to ensure accurate data and not waste money, it is recommended to go to a regular tertiary hospital for a special gynecological physical examination. In addition to routine physical examinations, sexually active sisters should also undergo special gynecological examinations every year, because cervical cancer caused by persistent HPV infection cannot be detected by blood tests, and cervical cancer progresses quickly and has a high mortality rate. Those who do not wear condoms and have sex are too young to be most susceptible to infection.

"我之所以跟你在这里说这些，证明我还有良知，如果是那些没有良知的，合不合法关他们什么事，结婚就是了，女孩无辜跟他们有什么关系，结婚有了孩子还是去外面找男人乱交，你有办法吗？我之所以这样说，合法了有良知的同志不会选择再去找女孩，既然法律都允许了父母也就会变得开明一些，你自己想想吧,父母以死相逼，你怎么选择，你不结婚他们就自杀，就是这么极端，我还是坚持最久的，如果今天合法，我今天就可以出柜，遇到合适的同性就结婚，遇不到就养父母终老，等自己老了就去养老院，不拖累任何人，不需要孩子，也不想养孩子，这就是多数同志的心声，不了解这个圈子就不要妄加评论，同志不等于代孕,身边很多被逼婚的同志，如果合法他们都不会选择去伤害一个陌生无辜的女孩，当你真正了解这个圈子，你才会发现有多黑暗，同志婚姻合法了，人才能迈出下一步，不合法就是空谈,至少可以减少很多不是吗，并不是所有人都想要孩子，但没有孩子又和目前的社会现状矛盾，中国老龄化严重，鼓励二胎也是为了多生育，太难了","The reason why I tell you this here is to prove that I still have a conscience. If it is those who have no conscience, it has nothing to do with them whether it is legal or not. Just get married. What does the innocent girl have to do with them? If you get married and have children, you should go outside Find a man for promiscuity, do you have a solution? The reason why I say this is that comrades with a conscience will not choose to find girls after it is legal. Since the law allows parents, they will become more enlightened. Think about it for yourself. Parents are forcing each other to die. How do you choose? If they don’t get married, they commit suicide. It’s that extreme. I’m still the one who persisted the longest. If it’s legal today, I can come out today. If I meet a suitable person of the same sex, I’ll get married. If I don’t, I’ll adopt my parents until I die. Nursing homes don't drag anyone down, don't need children, and don't want to raise children. This is the voice of most comrades. If you don't understand this circle, don't make rash comments. Being gay is not equal to surrogacy. Will choose to hurt a strange and innocent girl. When you really understand this circle, you will realize how dark it is. Only when gay marriage is legal can people take the next step. Illegal is empty talk, at least it can reduce a lot, right?

"那你的举例就不恰当，因为情侣之间并不属于“难以界定”……我理解的难以界定是这样，比如一男一女挤公交车，男的被挤得靠在女的胸上了，这样的是难以界定。,我们难道不是就你最开始提出的“情侣一方突然抱住另一方”而争论吗？,打个比方，你女朋友这个月管你借一百块钱，你借了，以后每个月都管你要一百块钱，你不乐意，你女朋友说某某一个月给他女朋友一千。能从要的钱数判断女朋友是不是吃穷了你么？对你造成影响了就是，对你造不成影响就不是。,在那拿什么情侣当挡箭牌，不管是情侣还是夫妻，一方对另一方的行为使另一方感到不适，严重的就是性骚扰。至于不感到不适的情况下，比如正常的牵手，拥抱，就不是性骚扰。很难理解吗？,就是以让另一个人感到不适为基准啊……感到不适，警告之后还不改，不就是性骚扰么。就这么界定。这种东西是很私人的感受，不可能量化成指标的。难道要量化成摸了几下胸亲了几下嘴？有的情况一次就够了。,同样是拥抱，在情侣间是含情脉脉，在叫兽那里就无异于杀人尖刀。今天在这里抬杠情侣之间拥抱亲吻算不算性骚扰，明天就有更多无辜的男性和女性被摧残。,更何况我跟认识的朋友开黄腔都是反复试探过他们的接受度之后才开始的，不能接受的话我也会闭嘴。上来就开车的莫不是脑子里进了震动棒。,两个人第一天认识，然后男方就给女方发他的屌，基本上女人都会觉得这是性骚扰的。还是那样的话，您非要较劲说“假如是朋友怎么办”“假如是情侣怎么办”可是这种情况下根本不会存在一方举报另一方性骚扰的情况啊。如果举报只能说明举报者是故意下套要害被举报者啊。,是您说的“恋爱中的男人想牵手要先跟女人说”啊，按常理推断女人不会把这种事当做性骚扰吧？要是遇到当做性骚扰的女人，这女朋友还是趁早甩了吧连飞机杯都不如。,您为什么一直固定在谈恋爱上？？难道性骚扰只存在恋爱关系之间？还是您觉得男人性骚扰女人就是说明他们之间存在恋爱关系？？,男人在外面随便拥抱女人就有可能被告性骚扰，这哪里极端了？当然不够完善，我希望能够同样约束到女性。您想想，您突然被一个疯婆子抱住蹭个没完，难道您不觉得受到了骚扰？这和您与自己女友亲昵动作的界限不会分辨么？,见过，男方立刻被赏一大嘴巴子的也见过，那不如直接按互殴算得了。,那是男女互相有好感！互相有好感女方为什么要去举报男方性骚扰？,所以男人是不会说话吗？追求的手段只有肢体语言？","Then your example is inappropriate, because couples are not ""difficult to define""... I understand that it is difficult to define. For example, a man and a woman squeeze a bus, and the man is squeezed against the woman's chest. Such is difficult to define. , aren't we arguing about your original ""one couple suddenly hugging each other"" point? For example, your girlfriend asks you to borrow one hundred yuan this month. You borrow it, and then asks you for one hundred yuan every month. A thousand friends. Can you judge from the amount of money you want if your girlfriend is poor? If it affects you, it is, but if it does not affect you, it is not. ,What kind of couple is used as a shield there, whether it is a couple or a couple, if one party's behavior towards the other party makes the other party feel uncomfortable, the serious one is sexual harassment. As for situations where you don't feel uncomfortable, such as normal holding hands and hugs, it is not sexual harassment. Is it hard to understand? , It is based on making another person feel uncomfortable... If you feel uncomfortable and don't change after warning, isn't it sexual harassment? That's it. This kind of thing is a very personal feeling, and it is impossible to quantify it into an indicator. Is it to be quantified as touching the chest a few times and kissing the mouth a few times? In some cases, once is enough. , It is also a hug, which is affectionate between lovers, but it is tantamount to killing a sharp knife in Calling Beast. Whether hugging and kissing between arguing couples is considered sexual harassment today, tomorrow more innocent men and women will be destroyed.

Could it be that the person who drove as soon as he came up had a vibrator in his head. The two people met on the first day, and then the man sent his dick to the woman. Basically, women would think it was sexual harassment. If it is still the case, you have to argue ""what if it is a friend"" and ""what if it is a couple"", but in this case, there is no such thing as one party reporting the other party's sexual harassment. Reporting can only mean that the whistleblower is intentionally playing tricks on the person being reported. , You said ""a man in love needs to tell a woman first if he wants to hold hands"". It is reasonable to infer that a woman would not regard this kind of thing as sexual harassment, right? If you meet a woman who is sexually harassing, this girlfriend should be dumped as soon as possible, even worse than a masturbation cup. , why do you always fixate on falling in love? ? Does sexual harassment only exist in romantic relationships? Or do you think a man sexually harassing a woman means that they are in a relationship? ? A man may be accused of sexual harassment if he casually hugs a woman outside. How extreme is this? Of course it's not perfect, and I hope it can be restricted to women as well. Think about it, you are suddenly hugged and rubbed by a crazy woman, don't you feel harassed? Isn't this different from the boundaries of intimacy between you and your girlfriend? I have seen it, and the man who was immediately rewarded with a big mouth has also seen it, so it is better to count it as a fight. , That means men and women have a crush on each other!

However, maternity compensation does not have to be reflected as a bride price, and the bride price is only suitable for those whose natal family and their own financial conditions are not very good. Finding a marriage partner is a comprehensive consideration of his character, economic conditions and IQ.

"哦对我觉得他挺奇怪的…讲真你们之间想法差异这么大，真的相处不来就不要互相消耗了吧…况且这个男的明显是想要找个结婚对象诶，选一个适合自己的不就好了，就算有问题也跟女朋友沟通啊。跑去吐槽有什么意义呢？而且改变/改造别人在我看来是挺烦的一件事情，两个成年人了，互相不适合就换个适合的呀…,不过我挺烦那个男生才开始恋爱半年就开始考虑结婚以后别人的钱要怎么花这件事的…觉得有点想太多了,我是反婚，但我是反全世界的婚姻制度，但对想结婚的人一点意见都没有，个人选择自由。国内结婚对女生是很没保障的，很容易遭遇很多事情而且法律也不保护她们权益。所以选择步入婚姻必须要谨慎。不过这些都不代表“想要结婚选择婚姻就是loser”啊。没必要强加自己的想法到别人身上去。有些人就是不懂。","Oh, I think he is quite strange...

有些网友的咒骂确实太低俗了，不知道为什么会有这么恶意的想法！！！但是我还会想一个事情是：冠姓权真的算家事吗？随父姓在社会文化里其实还是发挥着很大的作用，比如小孩随父姓，大家都觉得正常；但是小孩随母姓，我们至少会心里想到：嗯，这孩子的母亲应该是女权主义吧。还是有差别……,"Some netizens' swearing is indeed too vulgar, I don't know why they have such malicious thoughts! ! !

然而现实社会是相反的，男权社会大部分是父亲拥有冠姓权，有一些男人会体谅妻子生育辛苦，或者出于爱的角度愿意让孩子冠妻姓。一些女人为了有一个孩子和自己姓而不得不生两个，如果夫妻恩爱，如果父亲能够尽到抚养责任，那还好说，如果对待不同姓的孩子不能平等对待，那女人真没必要结婚，何必那么委屈,"However, the real world is the opposite. In patriarchal society, most fathers have the right to bear the surname.

我其实很佩服那些能够争取到冠性权的女性。大部分女孩子不是不想争而是争不到，女生争不到冠姓权，而说无所谓，这不是真无所谓而是假大方。而papi对于她而言，我个人愿意相信她应该不是争不到，而是她真的爱她老公，愿意生一个孩子和他老公姓。这其实是最理想的状态了，女性拥有冠姓权有自由选择的权利,"I actually admire those women who can fight for crown sexual rights. Most of the girls don't want to fight, but they can't fight. Girls can't fight for the right to have a surname, but they say it doesn't matter. This is not true indifference but fake generosity.

"其实我觉得差不多，但是，就性别攻击来说，显然是男性多一些，中国四五千年的历史，一直是男权社会，新中国建立不过短短七十年，还不能适应“真正的平权思想”的男性不在少数，甚至有些男性不能理解为什么女性要求平权，我认为这是相当落后的，这也是我支持平权运动的原因,你说的这一点我表示认同，但不可否认的是以史为鉴，大多数懦夫都永远会是懦夫。解决这种现状更好的方式也差不多只有实名一条了吧，可悲的是我们完全没有办法给那些人现实中的朋友提个醒——那些发表恶意评论或者故意引导话题的人,是恶意，但这是被放大了的恶意，在现实中绝对，或者说很少有男性敢当着大众的面骂一个女性骂的很难听，网络对于这些人是发泄的渠道，他们骂的不只是女性，是所有他们在现实中不敢骂的事情，部分女性也同理，这是人的性格","In fact, I think it is similar.

I agree with what you said, but it is undeniable to learn from history. Most cowards will always be cowards. The better way to solve this situation is almost only real names. Sadly, we have no way to remind those people’s real friends—those who make malicious comments or deliberately lead the topic are malicious, but This is magnified malice.

这猜的确实有可能。但是我个人依然不认同“不要过分强调女权”的说法。女权这个词还在被污名化的时候，无论是个人还是媒体，反而更不应该避开这个词。重要的就是“定义权”捏在谁手上。女权被污名了，哪怕换个“平权”的说法，反对者一样不会接受。倒是这种温和避让，是注定会被利用的。,"This guess is indeed possible. But I personally still don't agree with the saying ""don't overemphasize women's rights"". When the word feminism is still being stigmatized, whether it is an individual or the media, it should not be avoided. The important thing is who holds the ""right to define"". Women's rights have been stigmatized, and opponents will not accept even the term ""equal rights"". On the contrary, this kind of gentle avoidance is destined to be used.",,0,China

"不就是在争吗？连话都不让说，还争什么啊？女的只能围着厨房转是刻板印象，孩子大部分跟父姓也是刻板印象啊，都要争取都要改啊,所以我觉得，喊出来要求正视冠姓权的人是勇士，是没错的啊。过去我们改变不了，从现在一点点争取，一点点改变，努力工作、尽量不被糟糕的婚姻束缚，也是所有女性的诉求啊。从自己做起，呼吁周围人一起，也没错啊,确实每个人都有选择放弃或争取的权利，但是我十几岁时见到周围很多女人打女胎，骨子里很害怕的，感觉恐惧，不止是对女婴的残害，还是对母体的残害。请允许一些女性呐喊，哪怕不那么悦耳，因为不是所有人都有一样的生活条件，也因为这片土地，埋了太多女婴的冤魂,有人开疆拓土，有人撰写史书，有能力帮助更多人，或是站出来说出不平等现象，让后来人避开坑，都是在为一件事努力的。如果没有发声的人，又有多少人知道，法律规定孩子就是可以随父姓可以随母姓，而不是默认只能随父姓？起码我以前也认为，周围都跟父姓啊，从没见过跟母姓的。我觉得有人发声挺好的～,男的批评女权就罢了，因为动了他们的蛋糕，女的也批评我就想不通，女权本子也是在帮全体女性。噢，你是幸福的，不用帮，但总是有樊胜美那样的，有招弟、盼弟、念弟那样的。起码能唤醒一个是一个，能帮一个是一个,何不食肉糜，你要是睁眼看看几千万女婴连命都没有，无数女性因被家暴，但没地方容下她们，只能继续和施暴者一起生活，就会知道，偏激的女权本意还是保护女性的。我身边见过40多岁的大姐，打胎五六个女婴，你能说她不幸福吗？她是自愿的，可是如果不是大环境，她又怎么会糟践自己身子，虐杀自己孩子？","Isn't it just fighting? You won't even be allowed to speak, so what's the point of arguing? It is a stereotype that women can only go around the kitchen, and most of the children have a stereotype with their father's surname, and they must be fought for and changed. Therefore, I think that those who call out to face up to the right to bear surnames are warriors, and they are right. yes. We can’t change the past. From now on, fight for it a little bit, change a little bit, work hard, and try not to be bound by a bad marriage, which is also the appeal of all women. It’s true to start with yourself and appeal to those around you. It is true that everyone has the right to choose to give up or fight for it. But when I was a teenager, I saw many women around me beating female fetuses. I was very scared in my bones. Not only the mutilation of the baby girl, but also the mutilation of the mother. Please allow some women to shout, even if it is not so pleasant, because not all people have the same living conditions, and because this land has buried too many wronged souls of baby girls. More people, or stand up to speak out about inequality, so that later generations can avoid pitfalls, are all working hard for one thing. If there is no one who speaks out, how many people know that the law stipulates that children can take their father's surname and their mother's surname, instead of defaulting to only taking their father's surname? At least I used to think that everyone around me took my father's surname, and I've never seen anyone with my mother's surname. I think it’s good for someone to speak up~ It’s fine for men to criticize women’s rights, because they touched their cakes, and women also criticize me, so I can’t figure it out. Feminism books are also helping all women. Oh, you are happy, you don’t need help, but there are always people like Fan Shengmei, Zhaodi, Pandi, and Niandi. At least one can wake up one, one can help one, why not eat minced meat, if you open your eyes and see that tens of millions of baby girls are dying, countless women have been raped by domestic violence, but there is no place to accommodate them, so they can only continue to be with each other If you live with the perpetrators, you will know that the original purpose of radical feminism is to protect women.

当家庭主妇的，请要求丈夫给买好保险，给予各种补偿，离婚时有能力带走孩子，别到时候发网上问网友，丈夫出轨，自己家庭主妇，要不要离婚，离婚养不起孩子怎么办。想好这些，自己怎么选确实和别人无关。问题是，中国自古以来盲婚哑嫁，有多少女孩能想清楚这些再选择的？,"If you are a housewife, please ask your husband to buy good insurance, give various compensations, and be able to take away the children when you get divorced.

你搞错了一点基本概念，女性有自由决定自己的孩子跟谁姓这是平权，只准孩子跟妈性不准跟爸姓这是性别歧视，这是专权。只准跟妈姓不准跟爸姓这种女权专制思想和男权专制思想有何不同？这样想的人只不过是追求社会特权罢了，无关弱势不弱势。女权就成了女拳。,"You misunderstood a basic concept.

You know very well that this is a derogatory meaning in a patriarchal background. Doesn't misogyny mean re-understanding out of this background? Or give new ideas? ,I didn’t make it clear.

林奕含死后她父母告了陈星（现实中的李国华）。陈星说他们是自由恋爱你情我愿，给出的证据是奕含手抄的张悬《关于我爱你》的歌词。“我拥有的都是侥幸啊，我失去的都是人生，因为你担心的是你自己，我爱你”。他说，这是奕含给他的“情书”。 房思琪当然是爱的。她被迫地去爱了。 她强迫自己去爱了。,"After Lin Yihan's death, her parents sued Chen Xing (Li Guohua in reality).

"还有希望你看懂这些数据，上个世纪反而女婴存活率算好的，但数据逐渐增高，95年开始死一个男婴起码要死两个女婴以上，95年出生的孩子不就是现代人吗！好心好意看你说你不是杠是好奇就叫你百度找找论文呗还讽刺，你也就那样了，大学上过人口社会学都不至于说出你这些话,2000还算是上个世纪吗？堕胎男女性别我们无可求证，但出生性别比例严重失调不就佐证了女婴存活率远低于男婴？还有更多的数据麻烦你善用搜索引擎，不说百度行吧？连人口基数都不懂就按1:1划分中国人口也是够好笑，那老龄化出生率什么的都不用考虑？看这个当然是看出生率啊，相关论文自己找，不难,那你就去查二胎男女出生率不就行了？上个世纪打胎并不流行大多只能生下溺死，我就不都补充了现代社会可以看二胎？你不是好奇她数据如何得来我就告诉你一个获取数据的途径，怎么？吃饭还要我嚼碎喂你嘴里？中国2000年大规模人口普查的数据来看，“一孩半”政策婴儿死亡性别比例失调远高于“一孩”地区。,自1930年代后，中国高于正常期望的“超额女婴死亡率”便一直下降，但实行计划生育后这一指数一反四十年来持续降幅，出现陡升，从1970年代后的10%，上升到1995年的60%，网易新闻有相关报道，以前还有学者对此写了论文做了调查，善用百度,......？不知道有人口基数这个问题吗？你这个逻辑就和中国第一个人口诞生开始就按1:1来........关于女婴存活率低，大面积杀女婴这件事是曾发生过，杀男婴你听过吗？这些是旧社会容易发生的，发展到现代社会，其实你可以看看二胎男女比例就能看出问题来，微博应该可以搜索到，好几个地区极度失衡了","I also hope you understand these data. In the last century, the survival rate of female babies was considered good, but the data gradually increased. Starting in 1995, at least two female babies died for a baby boy. A child born in 1995 is not a modern person. ! Seeing you with good intentions and good intentions, you said that you are not a joke, but you are curious, so I ask you to search for papers on Baidu, and you are still sarcastic. You are just like that. If you have studied population sociology in college, you will not say these things. Is 2000 still the last century? We can’t verify the sex of males and females in abortion, but doesn’t the serious imbalance of sex ratio at birth prove that the survival rate of female babies is much lower than that of male babies? There are more data, please make good use of search engines, let’s not talk about Baidu, right? It’s ridiculous to divide the Chinese population by 1:1 without even knowing the population base, so don’t you need to consider the aging birth rate? Of course, looking at this is to look at the birth rate. It is not difficult to find relevant papers yourself, so you can just check the birth rate of the second child male and female? Abortion was not popular in the last century, and most of them could only give birth to drowning. Didn’t I add that modern society can see second children? You are not curious about how her data was obtained, so I will tell you a way to obtain the data, how? Do you want me to chew it up and feed it into your mouth? According to the data of China's large-scale census in 2000, the sex ratio imbalance of infant deaths under the ""one and a half"" policy is much higher than that in ""one-child"" areas. ,Since the 1930s, China's ""excess female infant mortality rate"", which is higher than normal expectations, has been declining. However, after the implementation of family planning, this index reversed the continuous decline in the past 40 years and showed a sharp rise. From 10 years after the 1970s %, rose to 60% in 1995, Netease News has related reports, and some scholars have written papers on this before and made a survey, make good use of Baidu,...? Don't you know that there is a problem with the population base? Your logic is 1:1 with the birth of China's first population... Regarding the low survival rate of female infants, mass killing of female infants has happened before, killing male infants Have you heard it? These are easy to happen in the old society.

"这种心态其实就是人的常态啊，希望借助她人帮她改成自己想要的。这就有点像在我国jc处理家暴，接警后把男的抓走，然后女的就开始撒泼了。我始终记得一句话就是，哎呀，我就只是希望你们让他改好就行了,嘛，因为原po在这方面的描述有缺失啦。我个人是认为双方见过父母，可能在相处过程中已经在考虑结婚了。虽然有些话难听，但是婚姻真的就是家庭的事了，养猫可以，但是结婚后就要考虑很多事情，再只顾虑自己就真的是自私了。其实这男的就应该和女方说清楚，真的没法接受就别处了。而不是网上来求助,对啊。明明是三观不一致，偏偏硬要分个三六九，讲真不养猫狗的人不懂这些不是很正常吗。我妈也觉得猫狗随便养养就好了，这纯粹就只是观念问题啊，在我看来很正常啊，我只觉得评论很可怕，我是讨厌结婚啦。但是微博上这种女人结婚就是失败，在家生孩子带孩子就是失败的观念到底是咋想的","This kind of mentality is actually the normal state of people, and I hope to use others to help her change into what she wants. This is a bit like the jc in our country dealing with domestic violence. After receiving the police, the man is taken away, and then the woman starts to act violently. I always remember a sentence that is, oops, I just hope that you can let him change it, well, because the original PO's description in this regard is missing. I personally think that both parties have met their parents, and they may have already considered getting married during the process of getting along. Although some words are harsh, marriage is really a family matter. It is okay to raise a cat, but after getting married, there are many things to consider, and it is really selfish to only worry about yourself. In fact, this man should make it clear to the woman that if he really can't accept it, he should go elsewhere. Instead of asking for help online, right. It is obvious that the three views are inconsistent, but they insist on dividing them into threes, sixes and nines. To be honest, it is normal for people who don’t own cats and dogs to understand these things. My mother also thinks that cats and dogs can be raised casually. This is purely a matter of concept. It seems normal to me. I just think the comments are terrible. I hate getting married. But on Weibo, this kind of woman is a failure to get married, and it is a failure to have children at home.

"嗯，男女都有发声的权力，“仇女”和“厌男”都不是可取的，有这些现象说明离平权还很远，不过也难怪，因为一直以来女性是被压迫的，有过激行为也是一种社会现象，但你的言论倒是还算理智和客观。,我一直支持男女平权，作为女性，也完全经济独立并时刻维护自己的权力，并为随处可见的不公而发表意见出声，但我不觉得你说的有什么不好的，事实上，女权运动的本质从来都是平等而不是反压迫，更不是把女权换成当初的男权，如果那样那就是矫枉过正更是对自己性别的自卑和不自信。","Well, both men and women have the right to speak out.

"白人的美洲移民及日本移民东北的开拓团也是类似性质的侵略集团。扩张战争是国家组织导的种族扩张，而大规模移民则是自发的，潜意识的种族扩张。其结果同样是占领新的土地，繁衍自己的人口，摧毁别人的文明，扩张自己的文明。黑绿移民潮，所做的事和纳粹德国并没有区别。甚至不费一枪一弹。,是的。一个哺乳动物，想生育不是本能吗？况且生育是男女共同的责任，涉及养老、经济、民族生存与扩张。欧洲就是只强调个人的权利而反对一切集体加诸个人的责任。,我爱中国女性。创造人口是整个民族所有个体的责任，不分男女。无论是从养老的角度，经济可持续发展的角度，还是从族群扩张的角度。我只是反对女权当中的逆向民族主义倾向。就类似于欧洲的，只要权利不要责任，一边反婚反育，一边反对养老金改革，一边诅咒老年人快点死。必然造成黑绿种族入侵，文明崩塌","The white American immigrants and the pioneering group of Japanese immigrants to the Northeast were also aggressive groups of a similar nature.

The wave of black and green immigrants did not differ from what Nazi Germany did. Not even a single shot was fired. ,Yes. Isn't it instinctive for a mammal to want to procreate? Moreover, childbearing is a common responsibility of men and women, involving pension, economy, national survival and expansion.

Population creation is the responsibility of all individuals of a nation, male or female. Whether it is from the perspective of old-age care, sustainable economic development, or ethnic group expansion. I just object to the reverse nationalist tendencies in feminism.

上次有个话题，然后说道生孩子，找精子库或者419个欧美大雕都好过国腩。然后有位回复说在美国呆了5年，觉得国腩好多了，不知道她能看到这条吗：不如你回国扛鼎好了，自己我在国内30年，也没有遇到一个让我愿意跟他卖可乐的男人，呵呵呵。想靠近一米的男人都没有,"There was a topic last time, and then I said that it is better to find a sperm bank or 419 European and American big eagles than to have a baby.

变革是不现实的，本来这些事也没有规定，就很难说去变革什么的，想改变所有人的观念太困难了，中国有那么多地方连义务教育都覆盖不到，女权主义很多时候就是女性自己的口号，自己激励自己,"Change is unrealistic. There are no regulations on these things, so it is difficult to say what to change.

"骗婚的男同属于子集，男同性恋属于合集，只因为个别男同骗婚所以整个男同性恋合集都不值得同情。这是你持有的观点，我的观点是这种观点太狭义。,个人的道理论证都证明个人的观点：同志和女性作为社会弱势群体都应该得到和异性恋和男人同样的权利；但是骗婚的同性恋（包括男女）是不可取的，但是由此不能说明整个同性恋群体不值得同情。如果论证有逻辑错误请指出。","Gay men who cheat on marriages belong to the subset, and gay men belong to the collection. Just because a few gay men cheat on marriage, the entire collection of gay men is not worthy of sympathy. That's your view, mine is that it's too narrow a view. , personal moral arguments all prove my point of view: gays and women, as disadvantaged groups in society, should have the same rights as heterosexuals and men; but homosexuals (including men and women) who cheat marriages are not advisable, but this does not explain the whole The gay community deserves no sympathy.

"什么时候极端成了褒义词？极端女权不能代表整个女权运动的人诉求，自然也会损害女性自身利益。女性平权要的是社会能够男女一视同仁，公平竞争岗位，公平接受教育。谁有能力谁升职加薪，不想生孩子就可以不生，孩子想跟谁姓就跟谁姓。当女儿就要跟爸爸姓时，妈妈还偏不让？说我们要追求女性权利？,首先本人很唾弃骗婚的同志，但是那些极端的同志骗婚并不影响我对这个群体的支持，同理，一些极端的女权，比如最近骂PAPI酱为什么孩子跟父姓的极端女拳也不影响我对女性平权运动的支持。如果个别同性恋骗婚就不同情整个同性恋群体，那么就因为极端女拳所以那些处于社会劣势地位的女性也不值得同情？","When did extreme become a compliment? Extreme women's rights cannot represent the demands of the entire feminist movement, and will naturally harm women's own interests.

Whoever has the ability will get a promotion and a salary increase, and if they don’t want to have children, they don’t have to. The children can take whoever’s surname they want.

你不知道男人的压力，跟了妈姓，入赘还好那没话讲，关键是花钱娶回来，我记得我们这边一男的因为孩子跟妈姓被父母斥责家里没后了，外面有女的嘲笑他说孩子都不是自己的，，结果自杀了，后来他老婆跟了别人，一个人就这么没了，没有后代，收尸都是老母亲收的，,"You don't know the pressure on a man. If you take your mother's surname, it's okay to marry. The key is to spend money to marry back. I remember a man from our side was reprimanded by his parents because his child took his mother's surname. There is no daughter at home. He laughed at him and said that the children were not his own, and he committed suicide. Later, his wife went with someone else, and she disappeared alone, with no offspring, and the old mother collected the corpse.",SCB,1,China
看那个关于孩子随母姓的街头采访，不就有位男士说“为什么要养一个外姓孩子”，这点上男人看的太清楚了，女人甚至都没意识到自己在养外姓崽,"Watching the street interview about children taking their mother’s surname, a man said, “Why do you want to raise a child with a different surname?” Men see this point too clearly, and women don’t even realize that they are raising a child with a different surname.",SCB,1,China

这样就能出轨了？你不满一不沟通二不离婚，花着老公的钱去享受别的男人带给你的温柔体贴，这算什么？ 这样居然就能将出轨正当化，真是让我想不到的。 网友们每每都能震惊到我,"Can cheat like this?

得了吧，他儿子女儿都出来指控他，他也确实娶了养女，他的案子相关信息我也看过，我没法相信他没有恋 童 癖。至于TC你让他一个新人男演员怎么搞，不像其他人一样严厉指责你就给你留点面子了。现在还嘴硬，怪别人不站在你这边，就是不肯承认自己的失败是由于自己干了错事罢了。,"Come on, his sons and daughters have come out to accuse him, and he did marry his adopted daughter, and I've read information about his case, and I can't believe he's not a pedophile. As for TC, what do you want him to do with a rookie actor? If he doesn’t criticize you severely like others, it will save you some face.

那我来总结一下吧：艾女士诬陷德普家暴（有人证无证，且艾女士提出控告后未接受法院验伤）导致其被迪士尼开除，艾女士出轨，艾女士对德普使用暴力（亦有证据，且艾女士有家暴前科。她是双性恋，曾在公开场合对前女友使用暴力）,"Then let me summarize: Ms. Ai framed Depp for domestic violence (some people have no evidence, and Ms. Ai did not accept the court examination after filing the complaint), which led to her being fired by Disney, Ms. Ai cheated, and Ms. Ai used violence against Depp ( There is also evidence, and Ms. Ai has a previous record of domestic violence.

确实够恐怖，参与其中的男女老少会把在他们看来“父权”的概念视为愚昧、落后、野蛮而进行全方面的灭绝和毁灭，就像种族屠杀一样，但这只是说明历史上思潮对立引起的血腥和残忍在不同时期会以不同的形式重演。,"It is indeed terrifying enough that the men, women and children involved will regard the concept of ""patriarchy"" as ignorant, backward, and barbaric in their opinion, and carry out all-round extermination and destruction, just like genocide, but this just shows the trend of thought in history The bloodshed and cruelty caused by the confrontation will be repeated in different forms at different times.",SCB,1,China
中国最流行的田园女权还是政治色彩浓厚，2020了就不要谈女权了，应该谈一谈人权,"The most popular pastoral women's rights in China are still politically charged. In 2020, we should stop talking about women's rights and talk about human rights.",SCB,1,China
连作为一个人的权利都被剥夺了，还女权？这种应该立法处罚啊，罚得很了就不敢了，未成年只能依赖家里了,"Even the rights as a person have been deprived, and women's rights? This kind of punishment should be punished by law. If the punishment is too high, I dare not. Minors can only rely on their families.",MA,1,China
"更何况女性又本身承担着一部分男性不承担的责任，那么精英女性的压力就更大了,wsc算上层男性来源于两点，一是自己有开公司，二是爹是王健林。那这里描述的富婆也应该有这两点其中一点。如果是后者，那无所谓男女，都是“天龙人”，羡慕就完事了。但如果是前者，那就说明这种富婆是有代价的，得是行业精英才行，也就意味着她们承担的压力要和男性精英的一样甚至更大。","What's more, women themselves bear some of the responsibilities that men don't, so the pressure on elite women is even greater. WSC counts the upper-class men from two reasons, one is that they own a company, and the other is that their father is Wang Jianlin. Then the rich woman described here should also have one of these two points. If it's the latter, it doesn't matter whether it's a man or a woman, they are all ""Tianlong people"", and envy is over. But if it is the former, it means that such rich women have a price, and they must be elites in the industry, which means that the pressure they bear must be the same as or even greater than that of male elites.",SCB,1,China

她们追求的不是平等，是反过来压迫男人。跟农民起义一样，不是要建立平等社会，是要建立新王朝。想压迫别人，又没有经济能力，只能靠性胁迫，一旦年老色衰就被扫地出门,"What they pursue is not equality, but the oppression of men in turn.

关键是不知道。男方是否表态帮助，女主是否需要帮助并表达需要帮助。最关键的一点是，国外的女生比较独立，认为什么都需要男方帮助是一种无能的行为。个人认为，关我屁事,"The point is not knowing.

It is impossible for the boss to give preferential treatment to employees regardless of cost. It must be calculated according to the workload and value of employees to the enterprise. Then there is a contradiction between capital pursuit of profit and preferential treatment for women's maternity leave in laws and regulations. Enterprises will not let you take money for nothing.

MeToo运动不可否认确实做出了很多贡献，让人们看到了关于两性平等的希望。但发展到现在已经变得有些可怕，很多指控名人的人完全拿不出证据，却使得名人完全丧失回应的权利，失去工作，甚至背负一辈子的骂名；而一些已经确认的受害人，不得不面对媒体和一些团体反复的提及，二次伤害加剧。,"It is undeniable that the MeToo movement has indeed made a lot of contributions, allowing people to see hope for gender equality. But the development has become a bit scary now. Many people who accuse celebrities have no evidence at all, which makes the celebrities completely lose the right to respond, lose their jobs, and even bear a lifetime of infamy; and some confirmed victims have to face it. Repeated references to the media and some groups compounded the secondary injury.",SCB,1,China

就是梁钰的事。女明星被屌子骚扰了，找她来求助。她发微博之后，粉丝又说能不能删掉微博里女明星名字的tag。然后女权这边觉得她们卸磨杀驴，明星粉丝那边也有人说不要沾女权沾女权会很危险、甚至有人说女权蹭热度啥的。然后就变成两边互骂…我也是看到了一些少量对女明星和女粉丝群体的辱骂，总之,"It's about Liang Yu. A female star was harassed by a dick, so she came to her for help. After she posted on Weibo, fans asked if they could delete the tag of the female star's name on Weibo.

这些人并不是女权主义者，真正的女权主义者不会这样攻击男性，我们要的是和男性和平共处拥有一样的地位，而不是通过贬低男性来提升作为女性的优越感！,"These people are not feminists, real feminists will not attack men like this, what we want is to live in peace with men and have the same status, not to promote the superiority of women by belittling men!",SCB,1,China

"蝻蛆以为只要爆吧一样爆了他们心中的女权领头，女权就会像蝻蛆势力一样一哄而散，但是女权是散装的野生geming，因为每一个都是真实的有脑人,不过这也证明了无人的理论：蝻蛆找头领一哄而上抱团，女权野生每一个都是会思考的独立人类","The maggots think that as long as they blow up the feminist leaders in their hearts, feminism will disperse like the maggot forces, but feminism is a wild geming in bulk, because everyone is a real brainy person, but this is also true.

那些自己做不到放下扛鼎就开除自己女权借的人，真的很无语。不小心当了驴次方而被中伤，自然要自己调整，这不是女权主义的错啊,"Those who can't put down their burdens and fire their feminist rights are really speechless. I accidentally became a donkey and was slandered. Naturally, I have to adjust myself. This is not the fault of feminism.",MA,1,China
她们跳出来，恰好说明她们知道自己真实德行呗。那一条条的全都说中了，着急啊。整天到晚拿百度百科维基百科之类的定义来念经，也不想想这么多拜登韦恩斯坦加盟会带来什么变数。拜登加油,"They jumped out, just to show that they know their true virtues. That's all on point, hurry up.

"哈哈哈，所以还是多谈几次好哦，多谈几次，定位就找准啦~,真的，哈哈哈，而且男的基本都是一直找不到的，女生其实单身下来我见过的基本都是要求太高啦,是啊，我以前就是觉得都行，只要自己愿意，爱找不找呗，后来工作中接触了好多年纪偏大的未婚女性，真的是不太好相处，感觉女性的情感需求还是很重要的，当然只是我个人感受，希望不要有人在你评论下面杠我","Hahaha, so it’s better to talk about it a few more times.

"是的，我也是认为合理的情绪宣泄并不是错误，涉及到侮辱性的除外，可是恩和的微博并没有侮辱的意思，只是评论区的部分人上蹿下跳。驴鼎不是侮辱性词汇，反而很形象的概括了当代中国相当一部分比例的婚女的现状,我是觉得分两派，一派不明真相，他们是理智的，驴鼎这样的词语在他们眼中是侮辱性的，故讨伐极端女权支持papi也只是这件事情上，并不代表他们未来成为男权代言人；另一派就是极端女权所说的“婚驴”，这样的字眼戳到他们的脊梁了像你说的急于割席，极端女权被打败，“婚驴”才能在苦痛里找到自我安慰。,在恩和评论只有60条时，papi那边就开始买yxh和热搜，后面的事情大家也都知道，“极端女权”的号相继炸掉，直接把ip地址屏蔽，创建一个新号就炸一个，舆论一边倒，从这时开始事情就失去关注的必要了，一方带资本，一方是10万粉的小博主，胳膊拧大腿。再后来papi彻底翻车还是因为她买了观察网的营销,恩和在papi公开怀孕时在微博提过一嘴未来papi孩子会随父姓还是母姓，那时应该就被papi盯上了。大概3，4（？）月左右，papi买的水军跑错了评论区，那时没人在意，可现在看来确实是资本下场了。papi宝宝出生后，恩和果然在微博内涵了papi孩子随了父姓，恩和的点在于papi一直标榜独立女性却拱手相让冠姓权","Yes, I also think that reasonable emotional venting is not a mistake, except for insulting ones, but Enhe's Weibo does not mean insulting, but some people in the comment area are jumping up and down. Lvding is not an insulting term, but it vividly summarizes the status quo of a considerable proportion of married women in contemporary China. I think there are two factions, one faction does not know the truth. They are sensible. Words like Lvding are insulting in their eyes Sexuality, so the crusade against extreme feminism and supporting papi is only for this matter, and it does not mean that they will become the spokesperson of patriarchy in the future; the other faction is what extreme feminism calls ""marriage donkeys"". It is said that in a hurry to cut the mat, the extreme feminism is defeated, and the ""marriage donkey"" can find self-comfort in the pain. , when there were only 60 comments on Enhe, Papi started to buy yxh and hot searches. Everyone knows the following things. When one blows up, the public opinion is one-sided. From then on, things lose the need to pay attention. One side has capital, and the other side is a small blogger with 100,000 fans, and his arms are twisted. Later, Papi completely turned over because she bought the marketing of Watch.com. When Papi announced her pregnancy, Enhe mentioned on Weibo that in the future, Papi's child will follow the father's surname or the mother's surname. At that time, Papi should have been targeted. About 3 or 4 (?) months, the navy bought by papi ran into the wrong comment area, no one cared about it at that time, but now it seems that the capital has indeed come to an end. After baby papi was born, Enhe really connoted on Weibo that Papi's child took the father's surname. The point of Enhe is that Papi has always advertised as an independent woman but gave up the right to bear the surname",MA,1,China
恩和虽然不无辜，她不该去干涉papi的冠姓权，可现在这个结果也不该是对的，papi一直以来对女性的刻板印象和恶意却被当作搞笑而忽视，无奈吧。,"Although Enhe is not innocent, she shouldn't have interfered with Papi's surname rights, but this result should not be right now.

"外公和公公可不是一个概念，可能你在说方言？你改了姓，也是和你外公姓，所以你是男权的附属品吗？是吗？,哇我越想你的逻辑越觉得厉害。女人出钱养一个啥事不干的男人，就是丧失女性主权，是男权的附属物。那我们应该大张旗鼓的表扬那些被男人养着啥事不干的女人啊，毕竟她们让男人丧失男性主权，让男人成为了女权的附属品啊！时代精英啊！,那你的意思是，如果一个男人出钱养了个啥事也不干的女人，他就是丧失男权了？","Grandpa and father-in-law are not the same concept, maybe you are speaking in a dialect?

A woman who pays to support a man who does nothing is a loss of female sovereignty and is an appendage of patriarchy. Then we should praise with great fanfare those women who are raised by men and do nothing. After all, they make men lose their male sovereignty and make men an accessory of women's rights! The elite of the times! ,So you mean, if a man pays for a woman who does nothing, he loses his patriarchy?",SCB,1,China
她的逻辑太厉害了，女人养男人=丧失女性主权，那岂不是应该大肆宣传女人应该被男人养，因为这样女人就能让男人丧失男性主权了,"Her logic is too strong, women raising men = loss of female sovereignty, so shouldn’t it be publicized that women should be raised by men, because women can make men lose male sovereignty",SCB,1,China
因为确实有女拳的存在，大家也懂女拳和女权不一样。不懂的人可能是憨批，就没有必要跟那种人再聊下去。女权最终的目的是男女平权，所以不仅女生要团结起来，男女都要团结起来。悄摸说一下我的观点，我觉得女拳师比男屌癌还要可怕,"Because female boxing does exist, and everyone understands that female boxing is different from feminism. People who don't understand may be naive, so there is no need to chat with that kind of person.

我看那个讨论里有一个论调，说女性在女权团体中与极端女权割席，本质上也是讨好男权社会为自己谋利。我当时就傻了，在拥有独立思考能力下我觉得她就是做得不对与她分道扬镳有什么问题吗？这个不关乎立场和社会背景，只取决于你的内心，难道你极端女权就是不能被认为有问题是吗？,"I saw that there was an argument in that discussion, saying that women's separation from extreme feminist groups in feminist groups is essentially to please the patriarchal society for their own benefit.

What is social protection? Is education and employment given priority to women, or is childbirth respected by women's wishes? When a man is humble, does the subway give up his seat to a woman or does he consciously sit with his legs together? There are some things like carrying luggage.

哈哈，男人从来没有把女人当过朋友，男女从来就是对立面。为什么现在鼓吹女人回家当全职，职场上一步步逼着女人回家，法律上男人的话语权占主导地位。不然你以为为什么那么多性侵的惩罚甚至还不如一个偷窃的？女人已经是最底层了，已经被男人不当人看了，你还想团结他们和他们做朋友？,"Haha, men have never regarded women as friends, and men and women have always been opposites. Why is it now advocating that women go home to work full-time, and women are forced to go home step by step in the workplace, and men's right to speak is dominant in law.

我改姓了跟我妈姓。再者，你以为谁愿意抓着她说她孩子跟谁姓？是她自己买热搜竖个靶子在那里，等着人来踩等着南拳来心疼，人家是为了复出做准备。一个几千万粉丝的大V为了复出竟然要靠跟只有十几万几万粉丝的小透明博主主动撕逼，还要炸人家的号来博取眼球，笑死个人，还不是生了孩子以后热度不高了,"I changed my surname to my mother's.

我和你的见解是一模一样的，除非是明显反婚的已婚者，否则我都不把她们归为女权伙伴。不管她们天天说多少生育危害，说多少谨慎婚育，说多少女人不能当家庭主妇要拼职场，但目的都是为了找个好男人嫁了而已。哪怕，男的之中可能真的有这样的男性，但数量1%都没有，还不如大家一起反婚。,"I have exactly the same opinion as you, unless they are obviously anti-married married people, I don't class them as feminist partners. No matter how much they say about the dangers of childbirth, how much they say about marriage and childbearing, how many women can't be housewives and have to work hard, but the purpose is to find a good man to marry. Even if there may be such men among the men, but there are not even 1% of the number, it is better for everyone to oppose marriage together.",SCB,1,China
"voiceyaya 也很奇怪，我之前关注过她，一些言论让我取关了，她虽然为女性发声，但实际上算是个男权。。她也同时为男性谋福利。为什么不支持在这种情况下为男性支援呢？因为现在还是男权社会，当然是帮女性为优先了。。现在帮男性说话等于踩女性一脚而已。,我见太多了，你知道MISS南吗？我首页很多女权都在转她，就是个很明显的维婚派，并且在评论里和她的粉丝一起冷嘲热讽极端女权，但大家都说她是女权，女权圈里公认的那种了，没有男权套路。所以这才是一个很奇怪的现象。反正我不喜欢她。","voiceyaya is also very strange. I followed her before, and some remarks made me unfollow. Although she speaks for women, she is actually a male chauvinist. . She also works for the benefit of men at the same time. Why not stand up for men in this situation? Because it is still a patriarchal society, of course helping women is the priority. . Now speaking for men is tantamount to stepping on women's feet. , I have seen too much, do you know MISS South? Many women's rights on my home page are referring to her, she is an obvious marriage maintainer, and she cynicizes extreme feminism with her fans in the comments, but everyone says she is a feminist, the kind recognized in the feminist circle, there is no male Right routine.

"我觉得反父权是反男权的核心，而父权就是仅通过男权婚姻交易达成的。因为男性无法生育。没父权就没重男轻女了，也就没职场歧视、生育歧视等等了，这是问题的根源。只要回归母系一切迎刃而解。维婚派根本没精力帮助女权，光是解决婚育问题她们就忙死了。,我觉得温和派其实就是维婚派，是觉得只要对方足够好就可以结婚，谨慎婚育，所以其实对男权婚姻有利的观念她们还是会支持，这和女权我觉得是相反的。而极端派就是反男权婚姻制度，甚至回归母系。,我觉得你理解错我的话了，温和 与 极端 并不对立，但男权的挑拨下，部分温和派开始跟风黑极端派了，而我要骂的是这部分随风摆的。而不是所有温和的。,只要骂了一句极端女权的那种“温和女权”我都让她去死的，我不支持。","I think anti-patriarchy is the core of anti-patriarchy, and patriarchy is achieved only through patriarchal marriage transactions.

Marriage maintainers don't have the energy to help women's rights at all, they are too busy just to solve the problem of marriage and childbirth. ,I think the moderates are actually the marriage maintenance camps, who think that as long as the other party is good enough, they can get married and be cautious about marriage and childbearing. So in fact, they will still support the concept that is beneficial to patriarchal marriage, which I think is the opposite of feminist rights. The extremists are against the patriarchal marriage system, and even return to the matriarchy. ,I think you misunderstood my words, moderate and extreme are not opposite, but under the instigation of patriarchy, some moderates began to follow the trend of black extremes, and what I want to scold is this part of the wind.

"之前已经说了，确实高知配高知，但是有些高知男要女的不光高知还持家，然后自己不愿意照顾家啊。这不就是矛盾了吗？,之所以拎出来讨论，是因为非高知在择偶上大多直接择强，她们的选择范围更宽，然后默认进入男主外女主内传统婚姻模式，矛盾其实不多，相比之下高知就是有点特殊。那些不知道自己几斤几两重的不管男人还是女人都不在讨论范围内。,一个女人进入婚姻的前提肯定是她的物质比原来好了，至少不输给原来，入赘老公帮她照顾家也算不输给原来。如果比原来还差，难道把爱情当面包吃吗？,不管时代怎么变，精神只是物质的附加品这个前提是不会改变的。,这么说吧，原始社会雌性单独养不起孩子或者养的面黄肌瘦的，加上比她强的雄性就可以把孩子养的白白胖胖的了。现代社会高知女性自己就可以把孩子养的不错，加上比她更好的丈夫可以把孩子养的更好，上名校啊出国留学啊。这很矛盾吗？,而且95后00后目前还没有结婚成家，还没到高知的程度，有的时候不是他们已经接受了，而是他们还没遇到这种问题而已，有可能到时候立场就变了。,你说的没错，确实已经有很多家庭做的不错的了。但是发生矛盾做的不好的也很多，学历高但是老顽固的人多得很。所以我说由此带来的社会矛盾是值得思考值得关注的。大家的思想都得慢慢变。我的感觉是，现在95后00后对这个比较接受，90后80后还是不行，他们还是比较排斥高知女性承担的家庭责任比原来少了。,现在的矛盾点在于，高知女性自己本身在职场上就很强了，她要么自己能找到在职场上比她还厉害的配偶，从而接受传统婚姻模式，她的选择空间就变窄了。要么就是她的丈夫虽然不如她，但是能够更多的照顾家庭，起码和她同等地照顾，但是由于传统思想，很多男性并不愿意这么做。,所说的婚姻没有意义可能偏激了，但是如果拿传统婚姻和男女职场同工两个方面同时要求高知女性，不合适的，这也是为啥很多高知女性反对传统婚姻的原因。一般情况下，如果女性赚钱能力很强，如果和男人一样，在家务劳动上应该是和丈夫同等承担，如果比男人还要强，男人就会承担更多家庭责任。,传统婚姻是平衡的，男性在职场上承担较重的责任（男强女弱），女性在家庭中承担较重的责任（男弱女强）。如果一个女的既不挣钱也不照顾家她的家庭是不会成立的，所以男性并没有吃亏。但是对于高知女性来说，如果你同时要求她既在家庭中负担较重的责任，同时又在社会上与男生承担相同的责任，肯定不平衡,原始社会之所以有婚姻，就是因为雌性很难独自抚养后代，换到现在来说，就是生产力低。至于温暖啊爱情啊都是附加意义，不是主要矛盾。你看本博主提了这么多解释了那么多，提感情了吗？要主次分明。","As I said before, it is true that a high-spirited man deserves a high-spirited man, but some high-spirited men want women not only to be high-spirited but also to take care of the family, and then they are unwilling to take care of the family. Isn't this a contradiction? , The reason why I brought it up for discussion is that most of the non-high-spirited people directly choose the strong when it comes to mate selection. They have a wider range of choices, and then default into the traditional marriage model of the male lead outside the female lead. There are actually not many contradictions. A little special. Those men or women who don't know how much they weigh are out of the scope of the discussion. The premise for a woman to enter into marriage must be that her material goods are better than before, at least not inferior to the original, and her husband taking care of the family is not inferior to the original. If it is worse than before, should love be eaten as bread? No matter how the times change, the premise that spirit is just an add-on to matter will not change. Let's put it this way, a female in a primitive society can't raise a child alone or raises a sallow and emaciated child, and adding a male stronger than her can raise the child to be white and fat. In modern society, a highly educated woman can raise her children well by herself, and with a husband who is better than her, she can raise her children even better, such as going to prestigious schools or studying abroad. Is this contradictory? , and the post-95s and post-00s are not yet married and have no family, and they have not yet reached the level of high knowledge. Sometimes it is not that they have accepted it, but that they have not encountered this kind of problem, and their position may change at that time. , You are right, there are indeed many families that have done well. But there are also many people who have conflicts and do not do well, and there are many people who are highly educated but stubborn. So I say that the resulting social contradictions are worthy of consideration and attention. Everyone's thinking has to change slowly. My feeling is that the post-95s and post-00s are more accepting of this, but the post-90s and post-80s are still not. They are still more repulsed by the high-educated women who have fewer family responsibilities than before. The current contradiction lies in the fact that a high-spirited woman herself is very strong in the workplace. Either she can find a spouse who is better than her in the workplace, and thus accept the traditional marriage model, and her choice space is narrowed. Either her husband is not as good as her, but he can take care of the family more, at least as much as she does, but due to traditional thinking, many men are unwilling to do so. It may be extreme to say that marriage is meaningless, but it is inappropriate to demand high-skilled women from both traditional marriage and male and female workplace co-workers. This is why many high-skilled women oppose traditional marriage. Under normal circumstances, if a woman has a strong earning ability, if she is the same as a man, she should undertake housework equally with her husband. If she is stronger than a man, the man will take on more family responsibilities. ,Traditional marriage is balanced, with men taking on heavier responsibilities in the workplace (men are strong and women are weak), and women are taking on heavier responsibilities in the family (men are weak and women are strong). If a woman neither earns money nor takes care of her family, her family will not be established, so men do not suffer. But for a highly educated woman, if you require her to bear heavier responsibilities in the family and at the same time bear the same responsibilities as boys in society, it must be unbalanced. The reason why primitive societies have marriage is because it is difficult for females Raising offspring alone, in today's terms, is low productivity. As for warmth and love, they are all additional meanings, not the main contradiction. You see, this blogger mentioned so much and explained so much, did he mention his feelings?

哗众取宠！第一，打人行为是错的，这个无论性别信仰和立场。第二，为何要刻意强调性别？强调是男人打女人却获得了其他女人的维护，而忽略了立场和信念，是女权主义者打了反女权主义者的工作者而后被女权主义者维护，两者表述差别太大，混淆视听。第三，被打者服务报社做了什么？,"Grandstanding!

其实当今社会，女性地位已经取得了很大的进步，但是其他领域女性依然不及男性，男女平等还要继续推进。极端女权很好理解的，就是嘴里喊着男女平等，实际上要求女性必须在各个领域都碾压男性，如果不能碾压男性，就搬出所谓“结果平等”这种实际上是歧视男性的概念来要求女性特权，否则就是歧视女性。,"In fact, in today's society, the status of women has made great progress, but women are still inferior to men in other fields, and equality between men and women must continue to be promoted.

对，这种女人必须依靠男人的思想本来就是男权产物。拿所谓女拳语录和“男人压力大女人要房要车要彩礼”来反女权的人眼界太小了。女权要的是身为人和男人一样平等的出生权、受教育权、同工同酬、财产继承、共同育儿等等权利，不是让女人什么都没有被迫当上门媳妇拘泥于婚姻里和男人、婆婆斗智斗勇,"Yes, this kind of thinking that women must rely on men is originally a product of patriarchy.

"但你也要当心自己在坚持正确道路上走向了绥靖政策和误解。你看下自己原来的发言和场景，我觉得你这种发言很可能被温和男权吸纳，希望保持警惕。,欢迎你思辨，但我觉得在女权运动初级阶段，要求所有人的言行要符合你的要求，这是不现实的。,那你就错了，很多时候我们就是在和男权做斗争，只不过大部分是男人而已。没有人会去撕三观正的男性。,那斗谁？在大多数男性还觉得生孩子必须生男孩的现在，在继承权默认都归男性的现在，在大部分男性觉得自己现在所得理所当然女人就是无理取闹的时候，在追不到女孩就想强奸打杀的现在，在女性被拐卖而买家是男性的现在——不斗男权斗谁？,这个可以有，所以男性应该给权给钱给资源啊，那不就是我说的嘛。教育权，工作权，财产权，继承权，一项一项给我们吐出来。,我觉得你可以批判一下男性中的败类，毕竟女性对男性印象不好，就是因为有些男性败类在败坏男性名声。,是男权在无视女性遭受的苦难，所以才引来反抗。你有这时间搞诛心论，为什么不先批判一下出轨的男性，家暴的男性？别看没看几本书就天天阴谋论。,笑死了，为什么要人为设置优势，为了资源的分配好吗？本质上就是钱，权，资源，不给女性这几样东西的所谓抹平男权优势，都是空中楼阁。基础没打好，光想造101大楼，还没睡醒吗？,理解力真是……我换个方式讲，女性创造了140男性也创造了140，现在总产值280，但男性要求分得196，只给女性84懂吗？,你自己再理理你自己的逻辑，我今天懒得高兴把别人的逻辑给理顺","But you also have to be careful that you are moving towards appeasement and misunderstanding while sticking to the right path.
